// Notes for development
// 1. Should the keys be shortened to reduce data transfer and storage?
//    Example: "C" instead of "Community".

// Message transfered through gateway. To know where to redirect the messages, we need the "Community" identifier which is the room a user is registered too.
// The payload is a JSON structured that is encrypted and digitally signed by the author. Do we need digest (message integrity) check as well?
{
    "Community": "DigestFromCommunity",
    "Payload": "EncryptedAndSigned"
}

// The payload is decrypted using the community key, which all members of a community has, will result in this "Payload" construct:
{
    "Payload": {
        "Room": "UniqueRoomNameNoSpacesOrSpecialCharacters",
        "Author": "UniqueAuthorIdentifierDerivedFromPublicKeyAlsoUsedToPickPublicKeyForDecryption",
        "Body": "EncryptedBody"
    }
}

// The Body element contains the actual post by the user, and must be decrypted with their public key (and it was signed with the private key)
{
    "Body": {
        "Id": "940572e6-32f1-424e-9ddc-2459577abb14",
