<h1>New invite</h1>
<p>You can create any number of invites to communities you own.
</p>
<p>You have to be online for members to activate their invites.</p>
<p>Invites are only stored locally on this device, if you run "Clear Device" and restore on another, the invites will no longer
    be valid.</p>
<p>Invites are single-use.</p>
<p>Invites can include information about gateway. This can be used to simplify the experience for new members, but it exposes
    the gateway used by the community. Do not include the gateway in the invitation for additional secure, and communicate
    the gateway with the member through other secure channels.</p>

<p>
    Community:
    <select id="community-invite-list"></select>
</p>

<p>
    Gateway:
    <select id="gateway-invite-list"></select>
</p>

<button data-ume-action="onGenerateInvite">Generate Invite</button>

<h2>Invite</h2>
<p>The generated invite is valid until you as community owner, deletes it from the invitation list (available within the community).
    The invite should be sent using a secure channel.</p>

    <textarea id="invitation-text" class="key-text" readonly></textarea>
