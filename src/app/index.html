                <h1>
                    Hi, welcome to üme, the collaborative community!
                </h1>

                <p>
                    üme is a bit special, it is decentralized and does not require any servers or installations. It runs in your browser, you
                    are both the host of the community and a member.
                </p>

                <p>üme is also special in another way, and that is how it enables community members to be anonymous and secure
                    in their communication.
                </p>

                <p>Since üme only runs in your browser, and the browser is inherently insecure, no garantue can be give in regards
                    to your privacy. All communication is secured with encryption and digital signatures. It is important
                    that you trust the content in your community, so every message is signed by the creator.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is important that at least two member is online in the community to ensure that data is sent. The community owner must
                    be online for new members to be able to join. Only the community owner's device can verify invitations.
                </p>

                <p>üme relies on a gateway for sending messages to all community members, this ensure that individual community
                    members cannot discover the IP address of another user. The gateway is open source, but don't use a gateway
                    host you don't trust, as the gateway could be modified to log the members IP addresse. Even with a log
                    of IP addresses, all messages communicated are encrypted and cannot easily be decrypted. You should combine
                    the use of üme with Tor Project and/or Virtual Private Network (VPN).
                </p>

                <p>
                    All the content of a community is stored in an unencrypted manner in the web browser. If your device is stolen, the information
                    can be accessed. There is an option to entirely delete local cache and always restore a community from
                    the other members. This is a handy feature to use if accessing a community using someone elses computer
                    or at an internet café.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The app have a very easy functionality to take local backup copies of your communities, make sure you use them often.
                </p>

                            your private keys. There are no way around this, as long as the app is built to run within the

                            do not rely on üme. If you still use üme and want better security, ensure you are using disk

                <h2>FAQ</h2>

                <p>
                    Q: Why was üme built?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A: It was built for the challenge of building a highly secure and anonymous forum that did not require any infrastructure.
                    Being able to create ad-hoc communities that only lasts for a project or certain amount of time, is something
                    üme is good for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also allows for people who don't want to use other social networks, which require a lot of personal information details
                    and does extensive logging and analysis of user patterns and everything that we share, to still be social
                    in a manner where the user decides how much information they want to share. The only requirement for
                    a user is a unique identifier derived from the public key. If you don't want to share nickname, real-name
                    or other contanct details, you don't have to.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Q: Will there be an üme app for mobile devices?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A: No, the app only supports running in the web browser.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Q: Are the content and security keys stored safely in the web browser?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A: No. There are few options to store local information in an encrypted and secure manner when only relying on the web browser.
                    Developing a Cordova and/or Electron container could enable more secure local storage.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Q: Can I use üme to share sensitive and secret information?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A: While the app has been built for security and privacy as the main reasons for existing, you should not rely on üme for
                    sensitive and secret information. This is an open source project with limited resources available for
                    security review and monitoring of potential hacks, exploits, etc.
